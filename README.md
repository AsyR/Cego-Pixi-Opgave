I have implemented a never ending loop of a bouncing sprite of a ball, using the Pixi JavaScript framework. I have implemented this using a static html file with a corresponding JavaScript file.

It is not possible to run this project in a Chrome browser unless you have tweaked the settings in regards to WebGLRenderingContext, therefore use FireFox or IE.
Open the index.html file in your favorite browser (-Chrome), and look at the bouncing football! It is possible to increase the speed of said ball, by hitting the 'Faster' button, and it is possible to slow the ball down using the 'Slower' button, to the point of a still standing ball.

I would love to dive into the whole universe of 2d animation and really learn to animate and implement using these technologies, and as I have never done something like this before I am also positive that there are libraries and plugins to help me implement effects like the Cubic Bezier curve bouncing effect. There is an 'error' that I have spotted, which is to do with the speed at which the ball is moving at. If the ball is at a higher speed the animation might seem like the ball moves further down than it should.

For the next steps I would have loved to implement a shadow beneath the ball that shapes in line with the ball moving, to really capture the bouncing effect. The possibility of squeezing the ball as it hits the ground would also add great effect to this animation.
